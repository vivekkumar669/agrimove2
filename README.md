## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get `agrimove2` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the `agrimove2` repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vivekkumar669/agrimove2.git
    cd agrimove2
    ```

2.  **Run Setup Script (Optional, for Windows)**
    If you are on Windows, you can use the provided `setup.bat` script to potentially automate some initial environment configurations.

    ```batch
    setup.bat
    ```
    *Note: This script's exact functionality depends on its content. You might need to adjust or skip this step based on its purpose.*

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    It's recommended to create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    Install all required Python packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can start the `agrimove2` application and access its dashboard.

### Starting the Application

Navigate to the project's root directory and run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

After running the script, the application will typically indicate the local address where the dashboard is accessible (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

### Accessing the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the application (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). You should see the `agrimove2` dashboard.
